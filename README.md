This is the code repository for [Internet of Things with Arduino Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/internet-things-arduino-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785286582) , published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.


##Instructions and Navigation

The code included with this book is meant for use as an aid in performing the exercises and should not be used as a replacement for the book itself.
Used out of context, the code may result in an unusable configuration and no warranty is given.

The code will look like the following:
```
/ Pins
int sensorPin = A0;
void setup() {
 // Serial
 Serial.begin(115200);
}
void loop() {
 // Reading
 int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
 // Display
 Serial.print("Sensor reading: ");
 Serial.println(sensorValue);
 // Wait
 delay(500);
}
```
